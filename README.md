# picotron-utils
Various command line utils for Picotron fantasy workspace. I needed them, so I made them.

## Overview

* `cat` - Prints contents of files (both text files and ones containing tables)
* `touch` - Creates empty files

## Install

Download scripts you need or the whole repository and put them into `/appdata/system/util/` directory on your Picotron.
